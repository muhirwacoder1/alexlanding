          Preventing Amputations: Early Detection is Key
        </h2>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Diabetes affects millions globally, and one of its most costly complications is the development of foot
          ulcers—often leading to amputation. Early detection is crucial in preventing these life-altering outcomes.
          Let's explore why early detection matters and how it's transforming diabetic care.

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">The Critical Window of Opportunity</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          When it comes to diabetic foot complications, timing is everything. Research shows that early intervention
          can prevent up to 85% of amputations. The challenge lies in detecting problems before they become visible
          to the naked eye or cause pain—often too late for preventive measures.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This is where smart monitoring technology becomes invaluable. By detecting subtle changes in temperature,
          pressure points, and circulation before ulcers form, we can intervene during the critical window when
          prevention is still possible.

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Warning Signs That Matter</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">The most important early indicators include:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>Temperature differences between corresponding points on each foot (often a sign of inflammation)</li>
          <li>Sustained high pressure points that may lead to calluses and eventual breakdown</li>
          <li>Reduced blood flow to specific areas of the foot</li>
          <li>Subtle changes in gait or weight distribution</li>
          <li>Micro-injuries that may go unnoticed due to neuropathy</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Traditional monitoring methods often miss these subtle changes until visible damage occurs. Advanced
          sensing technology can detect these warning signs weeks before clinical symptoms appear.
        </p>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">The Impact of Early Detection</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">Clinical studies demonstrate remarkable outcomes with early detection:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>A randomized controlled trial showed a <strong>71% reduction in ulcer recurrence</strong> with temperature monitoring</li>
          <li>Continuous pressure monitoring reduced new ulcer formation by <strong>86%</strong> in high-risk patients</li>
          <li>Early intervention programs have reduced amputation rates by <strong>47-72%</strong> in various healthcare systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          These statistics represent not just numbers, but preserved mobility, independence, and quality of life for
          countless individuals.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Technology Enabling Prevention</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Several technological innovations are making early detection more accessible and effective:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li><strong>Smart insoles</strong> with embedded sensors that continuously monitor foot health</li>
          <li><strong>AI algorithms</strong> that can predict ulcer formation based on subtle pattern changes</li>
          <li><strong>Telemedicine platforms</strong> that connect patients with specialists for rapid assessment</li>
          <li><strong>Mobile applications</strong> that empower patients to participate in their own monitoring</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          These technologies are particularly valuable in regions with limited access to specialized healthcare,
          democratizing access to preventive care.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">The Path Forward</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          To truly transform outcomes for diabetic patients, several key elements must come together:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>Wider adoption of preventive monitoring technologies</li>
          <li>Integration of early detection into standard diabetes care protocols</li>
          <li>Education for both patients and healthcare providers about warning signs</li>
          <li>Insurance coverage for preventive technologies and interventions</li>
          <li>Continued research to refine detection methods and intervention strategies</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          With these elements in place, we can envision a future where diabetic amputations become increasingly rare,
          replaced by early intervention and preserved limb function.

        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Conclusion</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Early detection is not just a medical strategy—it's a paradigm shift in how we approach diabetic foot care.
          By identifying problems at their earliest stages, we can prevent the cascade of complications that lead to
          amputation. With continued innovation and implementation of smart monitoring technologies, we stand at the
          threshold of a new era in diabetic care—one where prevention truly becomes the standard.
