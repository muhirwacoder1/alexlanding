      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">The Impact of AI in Modern Healthcare</h1>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare—from speeding up diagnosis to personalizing patient care. Let’s explore how it’s reshaping modern medicine.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Smarter, Faster Diagnosis & Treatment</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>AI diagnostic tools have reduced medical errors by up to <strong>80%</strong> and improved accuracy in imaging and pathology by 30–40%.</li>
        <li>Tools like Columbia University’s <strong>EchoNext</strong> now detect structural heart disease with <strong>77% accuracy</strong>, outperforming many cardiologists.</li>
        <li>Today over <strong>340 FDA‑approved AI medical tools</strong> assist in diagnosing cancers, strokes, and other serious conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Efficiency & Cost Savings</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>AI-driven automation could slash U.S. healthcare costs by over <strong>$150 billion annually by 2026</strong>.</li>
        <li>Administrative and documentation burdens are reduced by up to <strong>40–50%</strong>, freeing clinicians to focus more on patient care.</li>
        <li>Clinician productivity increases by 30–50% when AI handles routine tasks like chart notes or billing.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Remote Care & Chronic Disease Management</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>AI-powered monitoring systems reduce ICU mortality and hospital readmissions by up to <strong>50%</strong>.</li>
        <li>Wearables and smart assistants help patients manage chronic illnesses at home, improving engagement and reducing unnecessary visits―especially in underserved areas.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Accelerating Medical Research</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>In drug development, AI improves design and speeds up discovery, reducing timeframes by nearly <strong>50–70%</strong>.</li>
        <li>Healthtech startups increasingly use AI to streamline trials, match optimal candidates, and identify new biomarkers quicker.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Personalized & Predictive Care</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>AI-driven systems now predict hospital readmission with up to <strong>85% accuracy</strong>, forecast sepsis risk, and tailor treatment plans based on real-time data.</li>
        <li>Over <strong>75% of healthcare leaders</strong> believe AI will significantly improve patient outcomes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Ethical, Data & Equity Challenges</h2>

      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>AI systems can unintentionally reinforce bias if built on non‑representative datasets, risking inequity in care delivery.</li>
        <li>Patient privacy and regulatory compliance (e.g. HIPAA) remain critical concerns as AI processes sensitive health data.</li>
        <li>Ongoing collaboration between developers, clinicians, ethicists, and legislators is essential to ensure fairness and transparency.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        AI is no longer a futuristic concept—it’s reshaping healthcare today. From earlier and more accurate diagnoses to reducing clinician strain and improving chronic care, AI offers both medical breakthroughs and systemic efficiencies. As adoption rises globally, responsibly harnessing its power is vital to ensuring equitable, innovative, and patient-centered healthcare.
