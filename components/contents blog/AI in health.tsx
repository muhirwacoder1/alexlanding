      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Smarter, Faster Diagnosis & Treatment</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          AI diagnostic tools have revolutionized healthcare delivery with remarkable improvements:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>AI diagnostic tools have reduced medical errors by up to <strong>80%</strong> and improved accuracy in imaging and pathology by 30–40%.</li>
          <li>Tools like Columbia University's <strong>EchoNext</strong> now detect structural heart disease with <strong>77% accuracy</strong>, outperforming many cardiologists.</li>
          <li>Today over <strong>340 FDA‑approved AI medical tools</strong> assist in diagnosing cancers, strokes, and other serious conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          In Africa, AI-powered diagnostic tools are particularly valuable in areas with limited access to specialists. 
          Mobile applications using AI can help community health workers diagnose common conditions with greater accuracy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Efficiency & Cost Savings</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The economic impact of AI in healthcare is substantial:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>AI-driven automation could slash U.S. healthcare costs by over <strong>$150 billion annually by 2026</strong>.</li>
          <li>Administrative and documentation burdens are reduced by up to <strong>40–50%</strong>, freeing clinicians to focus more on patient care.</li>
          <li>Clinician productivity increases by 30–50% when AI handles routine tasks like chart notes or billing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          For African healthcare systems often operating with limited resources, these efficiency gains are transformative, 
          allowing more patients to be served with existing infrastructure and personnel.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Remote Care & Chronic Disease Management</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          AI is extending healthcare beyond traditional facilities:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>AI-powered monitoring systems reduce ICU mortality and hospital readmissions by up to <strong>50%</strong>.</li>
          <li>Wearables and smart assistants help patients manage chronic illnesses at home, improving engagement and reducing unnecessary visits―especially in underserved areas.</li>
          <li>In rural African communities, AI-enabled mobile health platforms are connecting patients with remote specialists, bridging critical care gaps.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          These technologies are particularly valuable in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure, allowing for 
          continuous monitoring and early intervention without requiring frequent hospital visits.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Accelerating Medical Research</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          AI is transforming how medical research is conducted:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>In drug development, AI improves design and speeds up discovery, reducing timeframes by nearly <strong>50–70%</strong>.</li>
          <li>Healthtech startups increasingly use AI to streamline trials, match optimal candidates, and identify new biomarkers quicker.</li>
          <li>African research institutions are leveraging AI to study diseases prevalent in local populations, addressing historical gaps in global medical research.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This acceleration in research is particularly important for developing treatments for neglected tropical diseases 
          and conditions that disproportionately affect African populations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Personalized & Predictive Care</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          AI is enabling more tailored healthcare approaches:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>AI-driven systems now predict hospital readmission with up to <strong>85% accuracy</strong>, forecast sepsis risk, and tailor treatment plans based on real-time data.</li>
          <li>Over <strong>75% of healthcare leaders</strong> believe AI will significantly improve patient outcomes.</li>
          <li>In Africa, AI models are being adapted to account for genetic diversity and environmental factors specific to local populations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          This personalization ensures that treatments are optimized for individual patients, improving outcomes 
          and reducing adverse effects.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Ethical, Data & Equity Challenges</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Despite its promise, AI in healthcare faces important challenges:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>AI systems can unintentionally reinforce bias if built on non‑representative datasets, risking inequity in care delivery.</li>
          <li>Patient privacy and regulatory compliance remain critical concerns as AI processes sensitive health data.</li>
          <li>In Africa, additional challenges include limited digital infrastructure, data sovereignty concerns, and the need for locally relevant AI training data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Addressing these challenges requires ongoing collaboration between developers, clinicians, ethicists, and legislators 
          to ensure fairness, transparency, and cultural appropriateness.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="space-y-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 text-gray-900">Conclusion</h3>
        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-4">
          AI is no longer a futuristic concept—it's reshaping healthcare today across Africa and globally. From earlier and more 
          accurate diagnoses to reducing clinician strain and improving chronic care, AI offers both medical breakthroughs and 
          systemic efficiencies. As adoption rises, responsibly harnessing its power is vital to ensuring equitable, innovative, 
          and patient-centered healthcare that addresses Africa's unique healthcare challenges and opportunities.
