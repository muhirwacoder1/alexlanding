      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        NEEM is a Rwandan-based healthtech startup focused on transforming diabetic care through smart, accessible, and life-saving technology. We&rsquo;ve developed an innovative smart insole that uses embedded sensors pressure, temperature, and heart rate to detect early signs of diabetic foot ulcers before they progress to amputation. Our solution is non-invasive, affordable, and connected to a real-time monitoring platform, empowering both patients and healthcare providers to act early and prevent irreversible harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born out of Rwanda and built for our communities, we combine affordable health technology with compassionate care to fight a preventable tragedy: diabetic limb loss. Our team of engineers, health experts, and visionaries are committed to making advanced diabetic foot care accessible, personal, and empowering.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe no one should lose a limb to a condition that can be prevented and we&rsquo;re working every day to make that a reality.
